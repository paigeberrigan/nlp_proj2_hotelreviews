# Project: Exploring Textual Data Analysis Using SpaCy

This project explores the use of **SpaCy** for textual data preprocessing and the training of various machine learning models for classification and clustering tasks. The focus is on understanding the impact of preprocessing techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, and removing stop words, while also comparing SpaCy-based approaches to other algorithms.

## Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Utilizes SpaCy for:
  - Tokenization
  - Lemmatization
  - Removing stop words
- Ensures the dataset is cleaned and prepared for modeling.

### 2. **Model Training**
- Trains four models for classification or clustering tasks:
  - Includes at least one SpaCy-based model.
  - Other algorithms: SVM, Random Forest, Neural Networks, K-Means, DBSCAN, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed with two hyperparameters per model, tested at multiple values.

### 3. **Performance Evaluation**
- Employs metrics based on task type:
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Clustering: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index
- Compares model performance across configurations to identify the most effective approach.
