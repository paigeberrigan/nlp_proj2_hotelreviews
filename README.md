# nlp_proj2_hotelreviews
Exploring Textual Data Analysis using SpaCy for preprocessing and training various classification and clustering models with hyperparameter tuning. This project evaluates model performance and compares SpaCyâ€™s capabilities to other machine learning techniques.

# Project: Exploring Textual Data Analysis Using SpaCy

This project explores the use of **SpaCy** for textual data preprocessing and the training of various machine learning models for sentiment classification task.

## Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Utilizes SpaCy for:
  - Lowercasing
  - Removing punctuation
- SMOTE 
- Ensures the dataset is cleaned and prepared for modeling.

### 2. **Model Training**
- 2 Models:
    - Neural Network
    - Random Forest 
- 3 Different Word Embedding Techniques
  - TF-IDF
  - Bag of Words
  - SpaCy
    
### 3. **Performance Evaluation**
- Employs metrics based on task type:
  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Compares model performance across configurations to identify the most effective approach and how they differ from eachother when it comes to classifying text.
- Runs a Gradio Dashboard to see realtime how user-generated reviews could be classifed by different model/embedding combos
